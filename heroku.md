Few common and neccessary adons used at ucreate are:

### Add Procfile
Procfile is a configuration file for Heroku app which tells Heroku the commands/tasks to execute before and post doployment i.e. 

- Your appâ€™s web server (Configure Application path)
- Run migrations
- Dynos configuration

Procfile is a file without extension.
Format to write commands in Procfile is `<process type>: <command>`
    where process can be type of `web, worker, urgentworker, clock` etc.

For Heroku to use your Procfile, add the Procfile to the root directory of your application.
